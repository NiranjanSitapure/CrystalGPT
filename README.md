# Time_series_transformers
Novel time-series-transformer framework that can show model predictions across N different chemical systems (e.g., crystallization), providing high system-to-system (S2S) interchangeability and more accurate time-series predictions than current SOTA ML models (e.g., RNN, LSTM, CNN, etc.).
